## Supermarket Management System

This mini-project “Supermarket management system project in C” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in Code Blocks with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic supermarket management task like adding the items, view the added items, search the items, pay for the items, delete items, etc.

This application is based on file handling in C, where I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, etc. Another feature is that this project is protected by a password, so, only authorized people can login to the program.

Also to increase the readability, I have broken the application in different function. Each function of the project extensively use the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling.

Also this project uses structs as a data model to encapsulate the items properties.
